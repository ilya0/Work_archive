Fill in the Blank Starter Code
===================================

- Copy this starter code into `~/code/wdi`
- Run `npm install` (this will install all the packages listed as dependencies in the `package.json` file)
- Run `mongod` and `nodemon`
- Check out all the code that is already in the app - what looks familiar? What doesn't?
- Write your code wherever code is missing (if you need a hint, read the comments!)
