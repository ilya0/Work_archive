## Objectives

- Use `$http` to connect to a 3rd party API

## Gotta Catch 'Em All!

For this lab, we're going to be connecting to the Pokedex API.

We're going to be using two separate URLs to get Pokemon data:

- 'http://pokeapi.co/api/v1/pokedex/1' has the name and resource URI of all of the Pokemon
- 'http://pokeapi.co/' will prepend all of the resource URIs to get individual information about each individual Pokemon
