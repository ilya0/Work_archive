# MEAN Boilerplate

## Getting Started

This boilerplate uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Make sure they are properly installed before continuing.

1. Install node packages.
```
npm install
```
2. Run the default gulp task to start your server.

```
gulp
```
When your server is running you can go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
