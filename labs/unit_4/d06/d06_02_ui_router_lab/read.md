# UI Router Lab

We're going to use the OMDb API again to practice routing with UI Router!

Use the following url to serach for movies: `http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=`
Use the following url to get a movie by the IMDB id: `http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=`

+ Start off by creating a search bar that when clicked will navigate you to a new state that lists the movies you searched for.
+ Each of the items in the search result should be clickable and when clicked will go to a new state that will show more details for that movie.
